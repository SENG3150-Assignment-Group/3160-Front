# FlightPub

This is the 3160 submission for the FlightPub project. It is a simple React app that allows you to search for and book flights.

### Version Two

This is version-two of the project, originally it was written using TypeScript and TailwindCSS, but for rapid development and cross-compatibility with other content it has been converted to 'Vanilla' JavaScript written in ECMAScript 8 and 'Vanilla' CSS which is linked rather than using CSS-in-JS. There is a CSS file for each component as well as 'global-CSS' which applies to the whole project.
